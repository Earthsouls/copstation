This version has modified makefile. Reason for this was to fix compile isue on SuSE 10.0
difference is in 
modif CFLAGS=-Wall -Os -I.
org   CFLAGS=-Wall -I.
without -Os parameter ISO extraction did not work on SuSE

          Coded and Maintained by Coldbird [vanburace@gmail.com]

   Credits go to... [Dark_Alex] - for the Basic Idea and Conversion Method
                    [Tinnus]    - for the CDDA Fix - AKA TOC Converter
                    [Coldbird]  - for EVERYTHING else

   \\GREETINGS//
   Its me - Coldbird... That Guy from LAN.st - Maybe you already forgot about me... :P
   I brought you all the first SE EBOOT Fixer for broken 1.5 EBOOTs - That still is being
   used for 3.03 OE even...

   This Time I bring you something different... Its more like a Mod, than a real new Homebrew.

   May I introduce you all to Copstation - My very own Enhanced Version of Popstation... :-)

   \\FEATURES//
   It got all the Standard Stuff you get to know from the Original Dark_Alex One...
   And it also includes Tinnus' CDDA Fix... Again - Both of them are credited above for their work!

   Besides that it got the following [New Features] : *) Bootscreen Exchange (The Warning Screen)       [V1.0]
                                                            If you place a Greyscale LOGO.PNG in the same Folder
                                                            as popstation and your ISO it will replace the
                                                            Original Bootscreen.

                                                            Sidenote: Do not attempt to use a Colored PNG...
                                                                      It will not corrupt the EBOOT or something but...
                                                                      The Opening Screen will be kinda puzzled and stuff...

                                                      *) No more BASE.PBP Madness...                    [V1.0]
                                                            All Needed Information to Create a EBOOT
                                                            is done on the Source-Side.

                                                            You are not forced to use a ICON0.PNG Image any longer...
                                                            If no ICON0.PNG Image is present in your Folder...
                                                            You simply will end with a Normal Icon-Less PSX EBOOT!

                                                      *) ISO-Extraction Support                         [V2.0]
                                                            If you were too scared to wipe out your old ISO Files
                                                            because you feared to loose the Data... This will be yours...
                                                            This new Function of mine is capable to extract both
                                                            uncompressed and compressed EBOOTs :-)

                                                      *) Process-Display                                [V2.1]
                                                            Now you finally can see how far you are with
                                                            and extracting of your PSX Games!

                                                      *) Auto-GameID Scanning                           [V2.1]
                                                            If you don't want to search for a appropriate
                                                            GameID of your Game... Bust It!
                                                            By using the Word "AUTO" as your gamecode on Tool Startup,
                                                            Copstation will do the Rest for you... :-)

                                                      *) Included Features from newest DA Popstation    [V2.11]

                                                            If you intend to use a different DATA.PSP in the EBOOTs,
                                                            place them in the same Directory as the other Files
                                                            under the Name DATA.PSP.

   \\COMPILING//
   As I'm a Linux User... I'm not capable of providing a Windows-Binary of this Mod.
   A Linux-Binary, compiled on my 64bit AMD System is available on coldbird.lan.st as a Extra Download named "popstation".
   The Linux Binary I provide of course only works on 64bit Systems (Yeah... I only got this Comp properly setup... xD).
   Sometimes User are so nice to provide me 32bit Linux and Windows Binaries that I can mirror on my Webpage...
   If you really can't compile the Source yourself... You will have no other Choice than waiting until such a nice Person
   forwards me a compiled Binary that fits your System.
   If you do another Mod, based on this Work... make sure that you credit all the persons that did previous work on
   popstation aswell like I did!
   Anyway, for compiling - Simply get a proper Environment Set-Up...

   In Linux you would do so in the Bash, and on Windows - you will have to use a Bash-Clone, called Cygwin...

   Not minding - What Way you choose, you wont have much more work than Navigating into the Folder where you extracted
   the Source and type "make" in the Prompt...

   You should end up with a Executeable File... :-)

   \\HOW TO//
   I won't write a explicit How-To here now... The very same Rules used for executing the Standard popstations will also
   apply here...

   Some Advice thought...

   When you wan't to include Icons, Backgrounds, Sounds, etc...
   MAKE SURE THEY ARE ALL IN CAPS! OMGZOR! - This might not be important on some Operating Systems, but many OS differ
   Filenames written in CAPS and those not written in CAPS...
   So you might end up with popstation not detecting your Images...

   Only Thing I have to add is... That if you want to include a Custom-Bootscreen, place a Greyscale PNG Image named
   LOGO.PNG in the same folder popstation and your PSX ISO reside in...

   If you do not have a LOGO.PNG (480x272, Greyscale, PNG) for Bootup, my Custom Bootup Screen for POPS will be patched in.

   Also... if you want to include Subchannel and Audio-Data into your EBOOT...
   (Important for Games like FF9, that otherwise will freeze somewhere in-game)
   Dump your Gamedisc using CloneCD (CloneCD works fine both in Windows and under VMWare... therefore also on Unix Systems)
   and instead of the .iso / .bin File, you drag all three Files into the Folder where popstation resides...

   Then just point popstation at the .img File (one of the three generated files... .ccd, .img, .sub) !

   It will automatically include Subchannel Data aswell as Audio-Tracks... ^_^

   For the ISO-Extraction Support... Simply call uppon the Tool with the following Parameter:
      popstation -iso outputfilename.iso

   It will look for a EBOOT.PBP in the same Folder popstation resides in and output the ISO contained in it to
   outputfilename.iso - Both Compressed and Uncompressed EBOOTs are supported.

   To force Copstation to Scan for the GameID - rather than using a ID you provide, just call popstation with the
   Parameter AUTO as your gamecode :-)

   \\FOR GUI-USERS//
   You should be able to use this Mod with about every GUI available - As the Commandline Settings remained the same.
   But you will lack specific Control of the Bootscreen Changes...
   Nontheless thought, you finally won't need BASE.PBP anymore... :P

   \\GREETINGS & ANTI GREETINGS//
   Hm... the Usual Stuff here - I greet Everyone that knows me and... Well - Ya know that Stuff...
   Especially I wanna greet - Mathieulh, jas0nuk, harleyg, cyanide, spectroplasm, corpdecker, and a few Peaple I prolly
   forgot about... And of course the LAN.st Peaple in General...

   This Time thought... I also wanna add a Anti-Greeting...

   Yes - Im talking about you Iceberg... You know who you are...
   Also... who doesn't like my Work... Go to Hell - I'm sure you couldn't even do something like this... So... SHADDUP!
